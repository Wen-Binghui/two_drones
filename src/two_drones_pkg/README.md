# Autonomous Systems - Lab2

After you are done coding, go to your workspace folder (i.e. `Lab_2/catkin_ws`) and build your code using

```
catkin build
```
If this fails, run `catkin init` to initialize the workspace. After a successful build, source your files:
```
source devel/setup.bash
```

Now oyu are ready to launch your drones using
```
 roslaunch two_drones_pkg two_drones.launch
```
